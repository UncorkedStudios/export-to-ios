# Export iOS Assets for Photoshop

A Photoshop script for exporting assets for iOS projects at @1x, @2x and @3x.

The script works by duplicating the selected layer (or layergroup) to a new document, then scaling it to each of the 3 common iOS sizes (@1x, @2x, and @3x) and then placing the files inside a folder next to the PSD.

## Installation
